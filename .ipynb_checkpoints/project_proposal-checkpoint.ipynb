    "Is it worth it to spend money on a new game? Many games charge high prices just for people to play it for a couple of hours and get bored. Some games are free and easy to keep playing, meaning players dont have to waste anymore money. I think it would be intresting to see how a games price affects its rating and playtime, as well as its popularity. I want to find the game with the highest % of owners returning to play the game. I hypothesize free games like Dota 2, CS2, and Player Unknown Battleground to have some of the highest player counts while not having as high of a return rate or as high reviews as a small community game like for example: Realm of the Mad God (A free rougelike pixel game which is not very well known). I also want to see the relationship to games price and how well it did overtime? If someone spends $60 on a game, does that mean they are more likely to stay with it to get their 'moneys worth?' I think it would be intresting to see if any patterns emerge and helpful to find games that are actually worth there money and or time."

    "I plan to use the Steam App List API which returns a JSON file of all the steam game codes associated for each title. On the steam webpage, the difference between links is a number associated with a game, so having a list of all the game codes is neccesary for webscraping the reviews and price of the games as well as other data. Another API I would like to use would be from Steam Charts. Steam Charts measures the player count overtime and also takes the game code. Lastly, an API to track ownership of the games would be from SteamSPY, which tracks the estimated ownership of the game as well as how many users play the game for 2 weeks or forever.\n",

    "The above data does not include every API I want to use. I would still want to get get ownership data for each game. Another part of my plan would be to create a dataframe where the game ID, name, monthly data, and ownership data is all in one big dataframe in order for graphing and comparisons. I would also consider using numpy arrays to compare numerical data to maybe make predictions about future data, maybe to predict success of a new game based on similarity to other games (or something like that). There is tons of data to analyze and lots of possibilities so I am not worried about my data having any major issues. The only real issue is that steam's api takes all the game names and id's which might make rendering my code take a while. I could possibly remove some of the excess data or see if the API has parameters for its call so that I can limit the number of games it gives me."
